I asked for something gluten free, and was told they didn't have anything. I dont know how I pay a lot of money to be in business class, and my choice is rabbit food.

1,"""The lounge was pretty grim""",Tony Maddern,2023-12-21,"✅ Trip Verified |  The lounge was pretty grim, no windows to look out. Food choices were very limited.

2,"""really let their standards slip""",M Kellett,2023-09-13,"Not Verified |  Qantas have really let their standards slip. The lounge has average beverages. Same quality I can get at home, $15 bottle wines. The food is non existent. Some cubed cheese, salads, bread and soup. No actual hot food items for lunch. I used to like visiting the lounge for a meal and superior wines before a long trip. No such thing here. This cannot be the flagship Qantas lounge. It’s embarrassing compared to most other airline lounges. All I can say is the seating is okay and free drinks are okay.",3,sydney airport,business class,august 2023,business,4,3,3.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,no,business class lounge
3,"""The lounge is absolutely filthy""",O Binder,2023-07-20,"Not Verified |  The lounge is absolutely filthy, chairs and couches are all stained everywhere. Carpet hasn't been vacuumed or cleaned for a very long time. The fabric lounge seats are in disrepair. A very very poor choice of food. Actually, not much to choose from at 11:30 am, 3 old salads some grapes, stick vegetables and hummus dip. That's it. Such a disgrace, and shameful for Qantas. Better off staying downstairs, with much much more food choices.",2,sydney airport,business class,july 2023,business,2,1,,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,no,qantas international lounge
4,"""The lounge was filthy""",Ed Blackwell,2023-05-11,"Not Verified |  Food was poor, and a lot of the cutlery looked like it had only been rinsed - not washed properly. The lounge was filthy and most of the furniture threadbare. The carpet in some spots was disgusting. The male toilets had excess spare toilet rolls stacked up everywhere and the sink overflows were black with mould and filth. The ladies bathrooms were worse with most of the stalls out of order. One member of staff could barely speak English. Qantas should be ashamed of this. Very disappointing to be flying business class with a ticket that was paid for personally.",3,sydney airport,business class,may 2023,business,2,1,2.0,2.0,1.0,,3.0,no,
5,"""service is friendly and efficient""",G Hallam,2023-03-21,"✅ Trip Verified |  The lounge is large enough, easily accessible but very busy.

6,"""not a special experience""",M Garsin,2023-03-16,✅ Trip Verified |  Crowded lounge with a limited offer of drinks and food. Nothing special to arrive early for but still better than waiting at the gate.

7,"""very tired and poorly staffed""",C Heales,2022-10-06,"✅ Trip Verified |  This Qantas Business Class Lounge is very tired and poorly staffed. Floors are dirty. No Towels for showers (they didnt get their delivery I was advised by front desk staff with a smile) and they told me to use paper towels to dry myself off! Tap handles missing and mould throughout showers. Absolutely disgusting.  Do not visit if you do not have to. Oh and if you are coming off long haul and want a shower like me, bring your own towel, and a wrench for the tap handle.",1,sydney airport,business class,september 2022,business,2,2,4.0,2.0,1.0,,2.0,no,domestic business lounge
8,"""a pleasant environment to wait""",Caroline Casey,2022-09-12,"Not Verified |  LHR Qantas Business Lounge is a pleasant surprise.  There is a restaurant at the ground level which has a nice selection of food with table service. Although the side note is that Platinum members appear to have access to reserved tables so it can be limited options if you are not a member. The desserts were a bit more limited and are self-service. Upstairs is a bar and seating area. Not quite as high quality as the lower level and a little bit hectic, but overall it is still a pleasant environment to wait for a flight. And feels of higher quality than the lounges in Sydney.",7,london heathrow airport,business class,august 2022,business,4,4,4.0,4.0,,4.0,5.0,no,
9,"""food that is of such low standard""",Florence Ilickovic,2022-08-14,"Not Verified |  It all starts with a very abrupt and patronising welcome by the gatekeepers. It sets the tone for the rest of the experience: terrible coffee, food that is of such low standard and very, very limited options. All this in a lounge that feels dated. Really an embarrassment to Qantas.",3,brisbane airport,members,august 2022,,2,3,2.0,1.0,3.0,,1.0,no,
10,"""the experience was terrifying""",C Tan,2022-07-23,"✅ Trip Verified |  I purchased a flight ticket from the Qantas website on a China Airlines codeshare flight from Sydney to Taipei. Upon arriving at the front desk of the Qantas business class lounge, I presented my flight ticket with my flight code and Qantas membership number. I asked the front desk staff to verify my lounge reservation (as the lounge was redeem with an AMEX credit card invitation). She didn`t even notice my flight ticket and she said ""we never work with with China airline, I don't know where your ticket is from"". Eventually she probably realized she was wrong, and she let me into the lounge room. As you can see on the photo, the buffet area was messy and uncomfortable. Nothing was refilled and seem no one do cleaning. I only stayed for about 30 minutes or so. To sum it up, the experience was terrifying.",2,sydney airport,business class,july 2022,business,2,1,2.0,1.0,,,1.0,no,
11,"""Extremely poor food offering""",Andrew Morgan,2022-04-11,"✅ Trip Verified |  Overcrowded and lacking in all that you would expect from a Business Class lounge. Due to flight delays we were in the lounge for around 7 hours. Extremely poor food offering - no decent breakfast option and lunch only after 12 noon. Lunch is a generous description - if you call unappealing chilli con carne (a cheap, stingy and ""cop-out"" offering also favoured by British Airways and a universally unappealing meal choice) a decent lunchtime offering. Officious staff which I found rather a surprise - like they're doing you a favour by letting you into ""their"" lounge. So many lessons to be learnt here - of what not  to do.",3,melbourne airport,business class,april 2022,business,3,2,3.0,1.0,,3.0,1.0,no,business lounge
12,"""facilities an absolute joke""",P Huang,2020-02-11,"✅ Trip Verified |  The worst Lounge I have so far come across. The catering was below average and nothing was a standout. Usually you can always find something decent to eat but the only thing I remotely liked was the beverages, with the alcohol hidden and only given when asked. The other facilities was an absolute joke, the one shower didn't even lock. Why Qantas let its Premium passengers use this Lounge is beyond my comprehension. The Lounge team were very polite, the only highlight I can point out.",3,denpasar bali airport,pay to use,february 2020,,1,2,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,yes,premier lounge
13,"""a good rest before boarding""",Alan Sargeant,2019-10-21,✅ Trip Verified |  Had checked in early and went straight to the business class lounge. Easy to find and was quite spacious. It was also quite busy. There was plenty of food and a good choice of items. I had breakfast in the lounge and also connected to WiFi which was easy and the internet speed more than adequate. It was relatively quiet (no flight announcements are made) so I had quite a good rest before boarding. It was not far from the lounge to the Boarding Gate.I,8,sydney airport,business class,august 2019,business,4,5,,4.0,,4.0,5.0,yes,
14,"""The seating is ample""",Neil Jeram,2019-10-18,"✅ Trip Verified |  I used this lounge even though was flying with Cathay Pacific. It is my home lounge being a Qantas FF. Now this is a combined lounge for all grades of flyers. It is also open to the terminal so there will be some background noise occasionally from announcements. This is one of my favourite Qantas lounges and with London, Singapore and Sydney First amongst the very best out there. The seating is ample. One thing Qantas might consider is putting in some recliners in a quiet spot. I had a 6 hour stop and so a few moments kip would have been great. The food choices were great. There is a communal table and a good place to meet and chat to your fellow travellers. The showers are good, not quite like the Cathay ones but do the job. Great bar also. If a One World FF, this should be on your default list when flying through HK.",10,hong kong airport,frequent flyer,october 2019,,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes,qantas hong kong
15,"""lack of customer service""",P Huang,2019-10-16,"✅ Trip Verified |  It was not what I expected. I know the space was struggling because of overcrowding but even with the extension to the lounge due to recent renovations yet I find to be a large space with no personality. The reception seemed like a space for staff to congregate rather than a warm welcome for passengers. So much seating including 2 bars and 3 islands for a buffet spread but the options for food was so limited I would rather eat in the terminal as Changi Airport is one of the best. Staff were present, cleaning and assisting where they could but that did not save face for the lack of customer service, catering and even power plugs. Due to the disappointment my partner and I went over to the British Airways lounge and it was top notch. I would recommend the Lounge but it really needs to up it's game and with the opening of the first class Lounge, that will give a better experience to higher tier passengers.",6,singapore changi airport,frequent flyer,october 2019,,3,4,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,yes,
16,"""decent food offerings""",Jai Satpute,2019-09-11,Not Verified |  The business class lounge was well stocked and decent food offerings. It was clean and staff were constantly walking around checking on passengers. There were great shower facilities and amenities. The only thing missing is a great view of the apron which is obstructed. I guess if you want this you would have to visit the first class lounge one story up.

18,"""the place was heaving""",J Mears,2019-08-13,✅ Trip Verified |  I'm probably in the company of many frequent flyers who have a gripe about the otherwise superb lounge at Changi. It just become a complete scrum at certain times. I was on QF2 en route to Sydney and the place was heaving. Had a quick shower and a plate of fruit but at the bar. Otherwise the place was packed. Qantas need to control numbers by limiting Qantas club members. The new First lounge cannot come soon enough.,8,singapore changi airport,business class,july 2019,business,2,5,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,yes,
19,"""one of my favourite QF lounges""",J Mears,2019-08-13,✅ Trip Verified |  The London lounge is a great place to visit. Great bars upstairs and downstairs plus table service. The buffet is good although this time the sponge cake was missing. I got there early and so had quite a few hours to spend there. It does get very busy and so took refuge in the book stores outside before heading off to the flight. Great barman this time who was very amusing. Some of the other staff could be a little more friendly but overall one of my favourite QF lounges.,10,london heathrow airport,business class,july 2019,business,5,5,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,yes,
20,"""superb First Class lounge""",J Mears,2019-08-13,"✅ Trip Verified |  QF Platinum has advantages and one of those is the superb First Class lounge in Sydney. In all respects a superb place to while away a few hours. I'm a creature of habit and he salt and pepper squid with the pork bao buns does it for me. Champagne also (even though its was 11.30 am). As one would expect of a lounge operated by Sofitel, things run well. A great view over the main runway but sadly had to run to catch the plane.",10,sydney airport,first class,july 2019,,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes,
21,"""ample seating for work""",C Kean,2019-07-22,"✅ Trip Verified |  The Strata Lounge design and ample seating for work is fantastic. In peak hours the lack of tables for eating is disappointing though. The biggest improvement needed is the quality/availability of restrooms. Some locks don't work and the lack of chairs, lack of ample hooks is very disappointing. Nevertheless the great thing about Strata is the consistent effort to improve the food offerings. This morning's visit the dishes were outstanding. Smoked salmon, great sushi and other gourmet offerings were superb. During off-peak hours the peaceful atmosphere is really enjoyable.",9,auckland airport,pay to use,july 2019,,5,5,4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,yes,strata lounge
22,"""experience was extremely poor""",D Garvey,2019-07-07,"✅ Trip Verified |  I used the Qantas business lounge in Sydney prior to a flight to Paris. I have used the lounge on many occasions in the past but this visit was very disappointing. On arriving, I sat next to power points so that I could charge my phone. None of the four points worked so I was forced to move to another chair. It was then that I noticed the food remains that were all over the carpet. They were there when my flight was called almost two hours later. The carpet itself was also dirty and in need of cleaning or replacement and my chair was the same. The hot food was extremely disappointing with a tasteless soup and only one other hot meal that was extremely poor. The only cheese available was small cubes of cheap cheddar. The red wine was 19 Crimes, a very average wine that retails for $12 per bottle. Hardly a wine to inspire business class travellers. The whole experience was extremely poor and particularly for Qantas’ home lounge.",2,sydney airport,business class,may 2019,business,2,1,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,no,qantas business class lounge
23,"""A very pleasant space """,J Buchan,2019-06-26,✅ Trip Verified |  A very pleasant space to spend 90 minutes or so after a long flight from Europe before my final flight home. On some weekday mornings the lounge can be very busy but the day I visited there was no shortage of seats and I had a nice breakfast and barista made coffee before catching flight to the Gold Coast.,8,sydney airport,business class,august 2018,business,4,5,4.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,yes,domestic business
24,"""disappointment was the food""",P Huang,2019-05-21,"✅ Trip Verified |  After reading some reviews, I was excited to visit this space before my flight home to Sydney. The interior is very contemporary with a great view over the tarmac that attracts amazing natural lighting and plenty of seating with charging ports. The staff were very friendly, and were helpful whenever needed. The shower facilities were great too, incredibly clean. The main disappointment was the food, it was mainly food to snack on rather then having a decent meal. Being a third party lounge, it's decent but I wouldn't recommend spending more than an hour in this space before your flight.",7,kansai international airport,frequent flyer,may 2019,,4,4,2.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,yes,
25,"""catering is first class""",W. Robert Kmen,2019-05-18,"✅ Trip Verified |  Anyone who has an chance to visit the QANTAS lounge at Hong Kong should seize the opportunity. The tended bar is a marvel, and the catering is first class. There are more than enough shower rooms even during peak departure times. The rooms are luxurious and spotlessly maintained. The lounge's large windows overlook the departure gates and the tarmac, but lamentably, at night they reflect the concourse lighting and are pretty opaque. They would be ideal for a daytime visit. All of the attendants were personable and outgoing, which I believe reflects Australian culture. Flying business class with Royal Jordanian, I had a choice of five Cathay Pacific lounges as well as this QANTAS lounge. As a lifetime member, I also could have visited the United Club, which was actually right above our departure gate. I think I made the right choice going with QF.",10,hong kong airport,business class,may 2019,business,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes,
26,"""background Muzak was an irritation""",David Ellis,2019-05-18,"✅ Trip Verified |  The Qantas Heathrow lounge is one of the newest in T3 and its major selling point apart from the gin bar are the two levels, with a dining area on the ground floor and the bar area upstairs. Despite the ample space, it was overly busy and the background Muzak was an irritation. Drinks (water included) had to be requested from the bar and the buffet was even worse than BA’s offerings in their T3 First lounge. Wi-fi was incredibly slow. Apart from the helpful staff on reception, staff seemed disinterested. On a positive note, the toilets were spotless and unisex.",5,london heathrow airport,first class,may 2019,,3,3,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,no,
27,"""food was surprisingly bad""",Juan Morel,2019-02-07,"✅ Trip Verified |  What a pity.  The structure of the lounge is quite ok. Armchairs are not enough comfortable and deco is from the 90s. But it is quiet. But the food was surprisingly bad. We arrive at 11 am and the breakfast was still there. Imagine dry hash brown as rock, dust scramble eggs. What is the reason?

28,"""due for a refurbishment""",P Huang,2019-02-04,"✅ Trip Verified |  I think on first impression it is a better offering than the Lounge at Auckland. In saying that, it is due for a refurbishment as everything just looks dated and in need of life. Since I was the first passenger in the Lounge, it was great to have food freshly made from eggs, bacon and pastries. Not much options in the drinks department, mainly coffee and soft drinks. The Lounge was very clean, including the bathrooms. Only 2 team members were present during my visit, I didn't see too much of them. Overall, it's a decent offering as I do prefer it over the Auckland Lounge but Qantas needs to lift its game in the Lounge department.",6,wellington airport,frequent flyer,january 2019,,3,4,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,yes,
29,"""Very ordinary lounge""",B Hay,2019-02-04,"Not Verified |  Very ordinary lounge, poor food and little option.

30,"""quite disappointing""",Ellie Nik,2019-01-30,"✅ Trip Verified |  For the most part quite disappointing. For me the lack of natural light and very small size area was the biggest weakness . There were no views overlooking the tarmac . The layout seem quite squashed too. I was leaving around 12pm lunch time, but the food selection was poor, very limited in variety . Unlike the bigger, major airports there was no separate business class lounge that is more exclusive . However the biggest strength was being within a few steps of my departure gate 3.

31,"2fairly congested at times""",Leon Ha,2019-01-29,"✅ Trip Verified |  Malaysia Airlines Enrich Gold, Business Class and Business Suites passengers flying out of Sydney T1 International Airport are entitled to access the Qantas Business Lounge. The receptionists are friendly and the sign-in was really quick. The Qantas Lounge layout is fairly rectangular, with plenty offerings available to passengers. There are also plenty of seats around the lounge, as well as different sitting arrangements to cater to different passengers and their needs. My first stop was the shower facilities. There were no towels available and I had to look around for a lounge staff member to get my amenities and towels for me. The shower room is fairly spacious, and comes with its toilet unit. Lunch is available after 11.30am The is Mediterranean tomato and basil soup, five different types of salad, steam jasmin rice, steam vegetables and braised red chilli chicken. The chicken was well-cooked and the meat falls off the bone easily. The salad is really refreshing and good choice for warm summer days. There are also different choices of alcohol and non-alcoholic beverages available. The downside of the lounge is because it is open to not only Qantas passengers, but as well oneworld airlines and Qantas partners, making the lounge fairly congested at times. Whilst there are a lot of staff on duty, they struggled a little to clean after the passengers.",8,sydney airport,business class,january 2019,business,5,4,5.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,yes,qantas business lounge

This lounge has been refurbished, but it seems like it does not indulge the requirements for being a lounge for premium passengers. The seats are not comfortable and tables are quite small. The time I visited the lounge was in the morning, so there were a lot of passengers at that time. But this was not a problem at all. Indeed, it feels like no staff was willing to clean up the rubbish and mess from previous passengers. The floor and tables looked dirty, and I had to pack things up by myself. Food choices were limited and staff in the bar were reluctant to smile and show their professional hospitality manners. Compare to other lounges I visited, this was an absolute joke. I really hope they can put their time and effort into improving it, as it was utterly pathetic.

33,"""Seating was difficult to find""",W Fane,2018-12-26,✅ Trip Verified |  Qantas International Business Class Lounge is below expectations. Pooling and sharing lounges appears to have hit critical mass. This lounge was at capacity. Seating was difficult to find and the lounge felt like a fancy boarding gate lounge. Comfort and privacy are not terms I would use for this facility. Toilets and showers were sub standard and unmaintained.

It is small and looks compact compared to the Emirates and Star Alliance ones. The F&B was limited; stuck to tea and snacks. Managed to grab a shower and that was also ok; nothing to write home about. It became very very busy to the point where it was easier to find space out in the terminal.

40,"""continues to disappoint""",R Teale,2018-09-06,"✅ Trip Verified |  The Sydney QANTAS Business lounge continues to disappoint. I travel QANTAS every 3 weeks and use the Sydney (and other) lounge/s for an expected comfortable experience and a hearty breakfast. I usually travel early in the day and this unfortunately finds me in the lounge at a time when it's often crowded. Sometimes I have to roam around until someone leaves before I can even have a seat. There are not enough places designed for eating at. Then there's the food. It's terrible. The mean-spirited selection goes from giant buckets of very sour Greek style yoghurts with fruity toppings dolloped on, to cold over sticky sweet Danish style pastries, to under cooked bland sausages (steamed in a covered bain-marie) with re-constituted egg slops swimming in yellowish water and steamed slightly mushy hash-browns and incredibly badly cooked bacon. There is a selection of supermarket breads one can put in a toaster. There is also a 'selection' of juices. Apple or Orange, and that's it. You're expected to eat this pathetic offering on a tiny plate, using pressed metal cutlery that's difficult to hold, often whilst sitting in a too-low 70's vinyl arm-chair with your plate on your knee (or for a greater degree of difficulty, use the little coffee table beside you). All-in-all, the QANTAS business lounges don't rate well when compared with its peers.",2,sydney airport,business class,september 2018,business,2,3,4.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,no,
41,"""lack of charge ports""",Stephen York,2018-08-26,"✅ Trip Verified |  New Business Lounge and had upgraded my flight so fortunate to be in the newly reopened and renovated Lounge. All very nice, good variety of food and drink options. New seating plan and good views of runways. The one thing I simply cannot understand is the lack of charge ports. They really need to do a walk-through some of the Virgin Lounges to see how easy it is.

The lounge is located only a short stroll from the departure gates and offers a great view of the tarmac. Compared to many other Qantas Club's at smaller airports in Australia, Cairns is quite large and there is plenty of room. On my visit the lounge was almost empty.

There seems to be no separate section for first class/platinum. The lounge was packed with people. Impossible to find a table to have something to eat. The little tables in the seating area were filthy. The lounge was very noisy with a lot of children running around and playing on the ground. Service at the bar was below average with the bartender seemingly annoyed that I asked for a drink. I had to sit down between uncleared dishes. Queues or the toilet. The toilets themselves dirty. The idea of a lounge is to unwind and relax before a flight. This lounge does the opposite.

It is tucked away above Gate 15 accessible from Level 7. My incoming was at Gate 60 or something. It is a long long long walk! Half way through was reaching for my Uber app and thinking I should have packed a sandwich! Joking aside the walk is worth it (although I am a Qantas FF and biased). The lounge is magnificent.

Had to ask directions from staff at other airline lounges before finding 1 sign directing me to the lounge. When entering the lounge there is the mandatory reception desk with a staff member pointing out food options and seating and apologising for the crowd. Did a quick circuit of the lounge and understood why there was limited signage. This is without a doubt the worst Qantas lounge I have been to. Cramped seating dirty dishes on every free table lack of natural light. A most unenjoyable place to be.

47,"""a huge disappointment to me""",Attila Toth,2018-03-31,"✅ Trip Verified |  This Qantas Business Lounge was a huge disappointment to me, which I used as a Qatar Airways customer.  I visited the lounge in the evening around 5-9 pm, before boarding the Qatar Airways flight to Doha. I was told that a la carte dining was only available for breakfast and lunch but not for dinner. The buffet had two hot meals, one of them a veggie option. There was no apple or orange juice, only sodas. Very poor wine and bubbly range and not too many spirits. The toaster station looked like an industrial kitchen area. The seating areas of the lounge were in lack of decor, the back of the lounge looks like unfinished and waiting for an interior designer team. The only problem is that it has been in place for 5 years at least. Though runway view is advertised to this lounge, the view is actually very limited. The sinks in the toilet have a weird arrangement, difficult to describe, but there are two sinks placed opposite to each other but shifted on one counter, so another person can stand almost opposite to you. Showers are nice and spacious, though I had to run the water for couple of minutes waiting for the hot water. If I had had another option for lounge access I would have chosen anything else but this.

I had a long layover and made the most of the lounge there. It is very large and so finding a corner is not a problem. Arriving there at 1am meant it was quite empty. Found one of those enclosed day beds they have their, like a mini cabin and dozed for a few hours. The food and beverages changes so a midnight snack of a slider changes to a full breakfast service.

The fact that frequent flyers are bringing in guests and taking up whole tables is a joke. It's common sense to cut down on some benefits and prioritise the true frequent flyers, rather than have a chaotic lounge filled with people who aren't even flying or just guests.

To say that I was underwhelmed is a major understatement. The place was absolutely soulless. Apart from a pleasant view of the apron I can see no other reason for using it in preference to the Emirates one. Maybe it was because the lounge is so big and that there were only about 6 other passengers added to the cold feel of the place. But what I found really irritating is that as I walked up the the bar to order a drink two staff mwmbers, one of whom was the barman were engaged in a conversation. The barman looked straight at me and the turned back to continue his chat. When i then coughed surreptitiously to attract his attention, he eventually saunterred over and said 'Yes' - that was it. I got the distinct impression that I was an encumbrance to him - hardly very welcoming So from now on, I will stick to the Emirates lounge.

Another discomfort is the seating and table heights, of which are so improportion that it makes dining inconvenient. The only place to comfortably eat is the actual dining area, which is one long communal table with limited seating.

Combining Australian fresh ingredients with international products to make a very tasty and healthy experience. The waiters were friendly and knew what they are doing. With their uniforms a big thumbs up! They serve the tea with fresh milk exactly like in their planes aboard. I have used the business facilities, including printers, everything was (as I said) perfect. I even got to use the spa and got a 20 minutes massage which made my day, before a 14h30' flight back to SFO, although that in the massage room the shower was not working (things happen, it is no problem) Thank you, Qantas!",10,sydney airport,first class,december 2016,,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes,

My husband and I have just arrived at Qantas Melbourne business class lounge to be turned away very rudely by a attendant at the lounge because my husband has thongs (flip flops) on. Now I understand that this might be their policy however what I don't understand is that they do not inform customers of this prior to checking in bags and how clean presentable thongs (flip flops) are not allowed - I have watched people enter with dirty runners and sock with sandals. What is the most disappointing part is the attitude of the staff. Having flown business class with several other airlines I now realise why Qantas is never rated as the best. Customer service is one of the big reasons people chose to upgrade. Very dissappointing Qantas!,1,melbourne airport,business class,december 2016,business,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,melbourne

I was finishing a coffee and just about to get a toasted sandwich when a Qantas staff member approached me and asked me to leave immediately as my host had left.  Of course I left but that really made me feel like a horrible person. As if I was there stealing the food and drink. I fly a lot and have to say there are other airlines that would not go that far. Is it really worth it treating people like this? A little niceness ususally goes a long and creates a good feeling in potetntial customers.

In a very rude tone, he yelled back saying the bathroom was downstairs, so I asked was there a bathroom inside and he replied back saying this is a business lounge in a very condescending tone. I am not too sure whether he thought that I didn't belong there from the way I looked. I was dressed in smart casual attire.

On that occasion, one of the Qantas CEO's new cost cutting exercises was to put restricted opening hours on this lounge due to 1 flight a day. That doesn't help when they close the lounge at 9.45 pm on a Tuesday night - and kicking everyone out - despite a delayed departure time of 0100 hrs (delayed 3.5 hours). Being a Qantas club member / business class passenger meant nothing - and never received a reply to my complaint. Then to depart on 19th November 2015, at check in I am told the lounge closed permanently the Sunday Prior (Thanks again CEO). But they tell me all is good - I can use the cheaper 'Louis Tavern CIP' lounges in Bangkok - only problem is they will not allow Qantas Club members to use the lounge.

The food is amazing, view is great, but everything else is just overrated. The fit out is just so 'common' - the wooden pillars/columns look great but the rest is just bare, with the old white marble looking dated. The seats are getting worn and are the output of style over substance - just too low to be comfortable. The cutlery 'specially designed for Qantas' looks like it came from Target. The carpet is horrible. Tried the Spa twice and it is a nice idea but just such average execution - good job it is free as I would not pay anything for that standard of service. I do worry about Qantas and their sense of style - the cabins, lounges and even new uniforms just look boring and dated to me. They seem to be trying too hard but there are too many misses and there is nothing distinctive about their design approach. The food in the lounge is amazing - the best I have ever had in a lounge.

The lounge seems to have more in common with the lounge at the leisure destination on the Gold coast than the Qantas lounge in Singapore. Traveling with a young child, I headed for the kids corner to keep our daughter entertained as we prepared for our flight. In this case the 'corner' was very much that, distant from the lounge proper so that a responsible parent flying solo with their kids is unable to get away to the bar or food counter to get any meals without packing everything up and lugging it all with them. There was no offer from the lounge staff to watch our bags, entertain the kids briefly or to bring any food or drinks. What was available in the kids corner was adequate but a few TVs and some toys and beanbags are not especially creative or novel. These small touches make a big difference.

The internet connection was difficult and rarely worked when connected just gave up on it. I wouldn't recommend it but there is no choice unless perhaps you use one of the paid lounges eg Priority Pass might be better. Seats were torn and the filling was coming out of many.

Not having experienced the previous one I'm guessing this is a vast improvement on what it replaced judging from the publicity. Decor is pleasant and modern with good bar / food facilities (if very cramped). Biggest problem is the First lounge isn't yet finished. As a result the new lounge is like an overcrowded food court with people using chairs as tables and footrests for sleeping that's if you can find a spare chair. The overall noise level is much like a shopping mall. There are also only 9 showers which seems inadequate for an international gateway port. It seems destined to become undersized only soon after opening. Having flown extensively on CX through HK & EK through DXB this lounge falls far short of those facilities. The biggest issue is zero privacy or quiet space which are what most long-haul business travellers crave and get in those cities. I guess considering the hell American air travellers endure in North America it's probably a welcome haven. But by international standards it's a falls quite a way short of the mark.

The food on the other hand is terrible. Qantas should be ashamed to offer this level of food to business customers. You could be forgiven in thinking that you are eating a sizzler.

Even later as I was there for a few hours prior to flying to Dallas I had some items from the self-service area which to me was quite an assortment of snacks to small meal-like offerings and beverages galore.

Another thing is the dress code (or lack of it) - some travel as if they are going to the beach. I'm talking of singlets shorts and throngs can't they buy a $5 t-shirt at least and a pair of joggers.

Breakfast is the usual fair chipolata sausages cold hash browns soggy tomatoes. Lunch is usually soup and a selection of rolls. The food in here doesn't match the decor even if it is hard to find a seat!

175,"""amongst the best anywhere""",P Taylor,2014-03-30,I guess if you come from Sydney or Melbourne you are spoilt by the QF first class lounges which are amongst the best anywhere particularly on the catering front and I also guess you shouldn't expect anything special airline wise in the US but really the all in one world first class lounge in Lax is pretty ordinary. Given most really long hauls like to Australia leave very late one would expect an option to eat before boarding. Well you can have snacks but that is about it. The other thing about this lounge and the business class lounge is finding them. They are on the 5th floor but given entry through immigration at the tom Bradley terminal is a bit like entering the corridors of an underground prison the narrow corridors and lack of signage give little indication of where to go for anything. Incredibly on the 3rd floor which is the departure level there is a completely new world of shops and glitz so why can't Qantas get with the new Tom Bradley theme. The other thing is the very good BA/Qantas premium check in area is gone. Now if want to check in early because your hotel has thrown you out it is an all in check in affair which despite the sign saying business/ first class means nothing. For those of you have tried to understand the psyche of the US travel who wants to pay nothing for the airfare but then argue at check in for a first class seat delays can be considerable.,3,los angeles lax airport,first class,,,3,5,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,no,oneworld lounge

For business travellers hoping for last minute skype e-mail etc before the 14-15hr flight back to oz forget it. Better staying in AA T4 and catching a late shuttle to Tom Bradley. It is consistently (6 times per year since this new lounge format opened) so bad I cannot begin to describe.,2,los angeles lax airport,first class,,,2,4,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,no,

The lounge was very clean and tidy well stocked with newspapers and magazines. The buffet was well presented and I noticed the staff replenishing and tidying the food spills. Barista coffee was superb and the young lady serving had a keen interest in her customers.

Also departing at this time are flights to all New Zealand airports and South Africa!! Plus don't forget all the One-World and other carriers that also use this Lounge. You do not need to be a genius to work out that this means massive over-crowding in one small time slot. Yet another diminution of the Qantas brand. A previously really good lounge with great food services and staff but never designed for the traffic in this time slot.,3,sydney airport,business class,,business,2,3,4.0,4.0,,4.0,4.0,yes,

We arrived at that time in-between breakfast finishing but being too early for lunch so there weren't too much food options available for us. The lattes were expertly made I have to say but would have been nice to have had some sort of biscuit/cake to go with them. Soft drinks were via a soda dispenser but the glasses are tiny - more designed for adding a mixer to alcohol than for someone wanting just a pure glass of Sprite. Plenty of magazines/newspapers to read or you can watch the world go by looking out the big windows that overlook the gates. Free and unlimited wifi was available in the lounge.,4,melbourne airport,business class,,business,5,5,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,yes,
183,"""A zoo""",J Moore,2013-07-31,A zoo. Used the lounge on 6 July 0830-0930 en route to Singapore. The place was packed to the rafters and seating difficult to find tables a mess of post breakfast debris and the decor is really showing its age - especially if you compare it with the First Class lounge next door. Australians are great lounge users through the QF Club membership scheme consequently international BC lounges are heavily used by economy travelling but club member passengers. Domestically Qantas has come to realise that Business class paying passengers deserve their dedicated lounges away from the scrum of the club it's now time Qantas realised that international customers paying a hefty premium to stay loyal to Qantas.,3,sydney airport,business class,,business,2,2,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,no,

I assume this was the new lounge in the Tom Bradley terminal. There were 3 large screen TV's with NBA MLB and NHL being televised. Bar service great with loads of choice as well as a self service area. More than enough space before our flight to Sydney at 10.10pm in the evening with a number of laptops available. Food selection not quite as good as Emirates Lounges but still adequate. Definitely recommend.,5,los angeles lax airport,business class,,business,5,5,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes,
185,"""noisy cafeteria styled open lounge""",G Satchell,2013-07-31,I fly in and out of Singapore on business frequently and naturally I was keen to visit the newly renovated Qantas lounge. Whoever designed this lounge has obviously never had to do business in an airport lounge. It has been transformed into a noisy cafeteria styled open lounge. The hard surfaces (walls and floor) create a vast noisy cavern with no consideration for acoustics. Qantas has completely overlooked the business class traveller here. There are no work stations or desk areas and if you need to print anything you have to go to the check in desk to collect your private and personal documents. I'm standing at a chest height bar trying to use the laptop as every table is full. If I sit down my hands are at shoulder height trying to type. Despite a good bar and what looks to be a good food selection this lounge is no better than the basic Qantas Club lounge in Sydney or Melbourne.,3,singapore changi airport,business class,,business,2,3,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,no,
186,"""amenities provided have all but disappeared""",Robert Grave,2013-07-31,Although the first class lounge has been in operation or a few years now and the standard of service in the restaurant is first class (run by Sofitel) the amenities provided (moisturiser razors etc.) have all but disappeared. There wasn't even a toothbrush to be had and I had to go to the desk to ask for one. Considering what one pays for business and first class with Qantas compared to some other airlines I would have expected better.,4,melbourne airport,first class,,,5,4,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,yes,
187,"""there was a nice feeling to the lounge""",B Rippingale,2013-07-31,Had a 2 hour visit to this lounge courtesy of Air New Zealand. Lots of seating with armchairs sofas and dining areas. Several TV screens with 2 large surrounded by comfy seating. Several shower/toilets well maintained and clean although unsure if how to get a towel if you needed a shower. There was a selection of drinks including spirits soft drinks and coffee/Tea. Overall there was a nice feeling to the lounge light roomy and welcoming. Unfortunately food was lacking in choice cold selection was ok salad cold meat and cheese. As for the hot food there was curry and nothing else. No choice and no rice to accompany the dish. This must be the worst business lounge for hot food choice anywhere. As for dessert there was a choice of chocolate brownies and lollies. Once again very disappointing. This would definitely put me off using Qantas Business class especially as this was the international Lounge. Overall good if you want to have a drink and relax but Don't go in to eat.,4,perth airport,business class,,business,4,4,4.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,yes,

Decided not to use it on the lounge in Sydney Int'l Airport as it is always crowded but on Singapore Lounge. My choice proved me right the new lounge is great there are more seats inside the lounge with power supply and USB charging. Staff fabulous and tables are cleaned when guests left.

189,"""lounge is spacious with a modern décor""",T Kinder,2013-07-07,Sydney International Business lounge is spacious with a modern decor. Around 13:00 once the lunchtime flights to LAX and Singapore depart it's quiet. The informal 'island dining' was pleasant and there were additional food buffets - including a very tasty Fijian style goat curry. The gelato bar was a nice touch - only 6 varieties but a nice after meal palette cleanser. There are ample Australian wines (no Champagne) top shelf spirits (but no malt whisky) international and Australian beers and soft drinks. A barista is present to make coffees. The staff were extremely pleasant - perhaps because of the early afternoon lull they had more time to interact with the few passengers waiting for the late afternoon flight to Dubai/LHR and were happy to have a chat. The vista is nothing special - though you can watch plane movements across the apron if that's your thing. Altogether a pleasant and enjoyable experience and a nice way to start a holiday.,4,sydney airport,business class,,business,5,4,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,yes,

How about sitting cafeteria style with bowls of buns in spots along the table where you would have to request another diner to ""pass the bread please"". It really is just so average. We had to go back to the BA lounge to use a computer. I thought it was a First class lounge but it is open to everyone from Qantas Club to Business class and everyone in between by the look of it.

A lot of people were using it the food selection was very good the service by staff excellent and the toilets were outstanding. Very very pleasant indeed wish this were the case in the Qantas Club lounges in Sydney and Brisbane (they need updating badly).

There is not much of a view from this lounge but not a problem for short stay. Internet wifi super.,4,singapore changi airport,business class,,business,4,5,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,no,
223,"""very clean and lots of staff""",T Patrick,2011-07-31,Lots of free PC's and different types of seating. Busy but some seating. Really good range of drinks and snacks- no sandwiches but lots of hot food and salad if wanted. Very clean and lots of staff.

224,"""lack of toilets""",D Weiss,2011-07-31,Qantas has hired room 5 above gate 21 which is a fairly large area. Lounge had a good feel to it with plenty of food and drinks available. Staff good and children rooms and business computers plentiful. Only gripe would be the lack of toilets. Toilets were huge one toilet rooms and the lounge only had two per gender. Seeing as this route has only been operating the last 2 months this lounge is more than adequate for the one Qantas flight,4,,business class,,business,5,5,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,no,
225,"""a pleasant lounge""",Ian Henderson,2011-07-31,A pleasant lounge with showers and willing staff. Fine selection of food - wines not a great standard. Plenty of seating and computer positions.

227,"""very good spa and massage area""",J Brien,2011-06-29,An exceptionally good a la carte food service provided and staff are very pleasant. Excellent computer facilities. Very modern and clean shower rooms with high quality amenities. The lounge also has a very good spa and massage area. Without question a better first-class lounge than any others that I have used.,5,sydney airport,first class,,,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,no,
228,"""it is very crowded and thus noisy""",K Franklin,2011-05-28,I use this lounge a few times a year. Every time it is very crowded and thus noisy. Hardly a place to unwind before a flight or between connecting flights. In fact it is one of the most crowded lounges I use anywhere in the world.,4,perth airport,business class,,business,3,4,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,no,

234,"""service was excellent""",Diane Lewthwaite,2010-09-06,Service was excellent. I had a long wait and after a very relaxing massage and shower I was tired. A member of staff spoke to me when I stirred just to check what flight I was on so he could wake me if I appeared to be sleeping through the flight boarding call. Could improve the amenities in the showers however for a first class lounge you expect female amenities rather than the more general ones.,5,sydney airport,first class,,,5,5,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,no,
235,"""staff are very friendly""",Steve Conroy,2010-09-01,As per previous comments - a small lounge which comfortably accommodates a full business/star class cabin and QF Club members. Not a lot is provided in the way of television entertainment however food and beverages are well stocked. Staff are very friendly and only too willing to help. Wi-Fi is confusing: as this lounge is shared with American Airlines it uses their pay- per-use wi-fi. This service is provided free to QF passengers. Talk to the desk staff who will provide you with details of how to log-in. This lounge certainly beats the cramped and uncomfortable departure lounges in HNL airport.,4,honolulu airport,business class,,business,4,5,4.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,no,
236,"""small but run by friendly staff""",Nicholas Janides,2010-08-28,Qantas Club at HNL is quite small but run by friendly staff who are available for assistance.

237,"""cleanliness needed to be stepped up a notch""",David Martin,2010-08-04,Staff although helpful appeared to think keeping things clean was beneath them. The cleanliness of the place needed to be stepped up a notch for me. Quality of the food was average the fact they shut the coffee bar was completely odd. I was told to use a cheap vending machine? Range of wines and other beverages generally good.,3,sydney airport,business class,,business,3,2,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,no,
238,"""Incredibly quiet, everyone was whispering""",Rob Johnson,2010-07-04,A really small and uninviting lounge compared to the normal QF fare. Incredibly quiet - everyone was whispering! No TV internet. Almost no food (packets of chips only for most of my stay then a few sandwiches) and no staff noticed when the wine ran out. Why not use the BA lounge instead?,3,san francisco airport,business class,,business,2,3,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,no,
239,"""a clean and tidy lounge""",S Conroy,2010-07-02,A clean and tidy lounge - although by the time all eligible passengers are in the lounge it can be quite cramped and busy. It is operated by two staff who work hard when the lounge is full as it serves both JQ and QF flights including QC members traveling on JetStar economy. I recommend arriving early as access can be denied when the lounge hits peak capacity. There can be a lengthy queue to enter at times as there is only one person manning the reception desk and she must record your details manually as you enter. Food and beverage amenities are adequate. There is no television but there are 3 PC terminals. WiFi coverage is a bit confusing as most pax needing access needed staff assistance to log in. Overall a good lounge and an alternative to the bus shelter that is HNL terminal.,4,honolulu airport,business class,,business,4,5,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,no,
240,"""very limited selection of food""",L Norton,2010-02-01,Crowded. One main seating area mainly lounge seats with some cafe tables next to the bar but also separate areas to watch TV. Very limited selection of food although could purchase some cafe style meals. Complimentary vouchers (2/person) for drinks. There is a small children's room with electronic games and computer. Bathrooms located only at one end of lounge which seems a long way from TV areas. Only 2 computers were available on the evening we flew (other 2 out of action) which seems inadequate for such a busy lounge.,2,los angeles lax airport,business class,,business,3,3,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,no,
241,"""such a bad First Class lounge""",D Weiss,2010-01-23,Never in many years of travel have I experienced such a bad First Class lounge. Was there mid- morning no food selection to speak of just cereals. Plenty of champagne though. Tiny area with not enough seats for the 4-5 flights that leave around 11am. Received a very late boarding call resulting in us holding up the plane as it was ready to leave. Compared to most Qantas lounges in the world this was disgraceful. Qantas need to re-think how they treat their platinum members especially considering that this lounge also caters for the EVA air flight and JAL.,2,brisbane airport,first class,,,3,3,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,no,
242,"""lounge did the job well""",Alan Wan,2010-01-17,I was an Air New Zealand Business Class ticket holder and I was surprised the plane did not depart from T1 like most Star Alliance flights but discovered ANZ code share with JAL hence T2. Anyway I arrived from T1 on the inter terminal shuttle and asked at the transfer desk which lounge I could use and I was directed to the Qantas business lounge. I had a shower and used the internet stations. The choice of food was okay - nothing specatular. For a 30 minute use the lounge did the job well.,4,tokyo narita airport,business class,,business,4,5,3.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,no,
243,"""staff here are warm friendly and helpful""",A Donnellan,2009-12-04,I have written before extolling the virtues of this lounge and there are none better. Have just finished a delicious breakfast of eggs benedict with smoked trout two of the best lattes I have ever tasted and fresh OJ. The staff here are warm friendly and helpful. It is the best way to start a 14 hour flight to the US.,4,sydney airport,first class,,,5,5,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,no,
244,"""could have done with a good vacuum""",J Andrews,2009-11-10,To be honest the QF domestic Business class lounge is not much different from the QF Club. Aside from fewer people and prettier light fittings almost everything else is the same. The so-called Neil Perry signature food selection amounts to little more than a plate full of fancy party pies. The obligatorily QF Club carrot and celery sticks also adorned the Business class lounge buffet too. I visited the lounge mid-morning and it certainly could have done with a good vacuum clean. Also noted that the tiles in the male toilets had been stripped off revealing the besa-brick construction (very attractive!).,2,sydney airport,business class,,business,3,2,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,no,
245,"""the hype is better than the reality""",E Hochstatter,2009-10-06,I think this is the case where the hype is better than the reality. Whilst the Qantas First Class lounge in Sydney is very nice with its openness and design the lack of attention to detail lets it down. The first impression upon entering the main lounge - a dirty floor going up the escalator to the top floor. Toilets - not only was the floor filthy beyond belief but two out of the four toilet stalls were either not flushed or had excrement in them. When I informed reception of this they told me that they just had a lot of flights leaving. Is this suppose to be an excuse? If they knew this then someone should have been right on it. Nearly half of the computers did not work. One had a virus warning flashing on the screen! The restaurant had an excellent selection of food which was tasty and made to order. The wine selection was the best I have seen. Also the spa centre was brilliant! I had the best face and neck massage that I can recall. Although my wife was less impressed with her manicure. Overall this is a very good lounge but is let down by a lack of attention to detail.,4,sydney airport,first class,,,4,3,5.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,no,
246,"""friendly and enthusiastic staff""",Bill Atkin,2009-09-06,Friendly and enthusiastic staff good service clean and well maintained and plenty of space. Good food choices - all in all a sense of really being appreciated.,4,sydney airport,first class,,,5,5,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,no,
247,"""can get a little crowded""",Garth Freeman,2009-06-08,What a surprise compared to the hideous Admirals Club in Terminal 4. Hot meals (chilli con carne chicken stir fry etc with rice and noodles) choice of 3 beers good red and white wines and spirits bar. Plenty of PC's to catch up with emails courteous attentive staff. Great shower rooms although the water outlets need replacement. Plenty of space in a quiet relaxing environment. Can get a little crowded when 2 hours from 4 flights departing. Overall especially in terms of lounges in the US very good.,4,los angeles lax airport,business class,,business,5,4,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,no,
248,"""ambience is active but quiet""",T Newman,2009-05-31,The ambience is active but quiet. From the telephone call the day before asking us what time we would be arriving so the kurbside porter could help us with our luggage to the boarding of the plane all needs were met. My partner was wished a Happy Birthday from every staff member who met us at check in at the Lounge entrance and after our meal in the Lounge restaurant where my partner was presented with a small birthday platter of fruit. All this occurred by a mere mention of the event during my telephone conversation the day before.,5,sydney airport,first class,,,5,5,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,no,
249,"""lounge is immaculately maintained""",A Mitchell,2009-02-28,This lounge is immaculately maintained - as was stated previously can become somewhat irritating as they will pounce on a finished glass of drink or cleared plate - can't really complain though. The catering is slightly above basic with some hot foods and soups and the usual au dourves biscuits cheeses and anti pesto. There is no bar but rather a self serve fridge as in Melbourne and Sydney international business lounges and a few post-mixes dotted around the lounge. The wine-bar area and the open round tabled seating area near the main food area are great for socialising while the darker quite areas are adequate but the lounges are not as comfortable as they appear. Plus the big floor to ceiling windows which run around the far side of the lounge are great to watch the goings on of the terminal below. The showers are incredible probably the best I've seen in a non first lounge. On the downside the lounge as with QF/BA First Thai United Lounges a fair walk from the QF/BA gates and up a set of escalators and very hard to find. But it handles to steady flow of numbers very well and never feels full despite the time of day.,4,singapore changi airport,business class,,business,4,5,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,no,
250,"""staff were attentive and friendly""",A Donnellan,2009-02-07,The staff were attentive and friendly. As there is no airside pharmacy in Sydney international a staff member actually took my script had it filled at a pharmacy in another part of the airport had it cleared by security and delivered to my table. Now that's service! The menu is the restaurant is short sharp simple and of excellent quality. The facilities are great I like that you can choose to use either Mac or PC in this lounge. They have a very nice day spa hard to get into but when you do very much worth the effort. The bathrooms are not that great but you really are not there to spend too much time in there. It's wonderfully spacious with plenty of places to sit. The only annoying factor was the number of children in the lounge. All in all a great place. This lounge is the only reason that I will continue to use Qantas it's a great benefit for platinum frequent flyers- Qantas inflight service could learn a lot from this lounge.,5,sydney airport,first class,,,5,5,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,no,
251,"""very spacious with nice views""",J Roggeveen,2009-02-07,Sydney business lounge very spacious with nice views. Food quality good hot food offering of soup and meat pies a little disappointing but cold meats cheese were of a high standard and bread was fresh. Lounge feels too modern could do with some nice artwork to enliven the space. Nice light fixtures particularly at the large communal style wine bar. Plenty of room to relax and find privacy if needed. Nice mix of seating arrangements. Nice showers. Overall a pleasant pre flight experience.,4,sydney airport,business class,,business,4,4,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,no,
252,"""extremely warm temperature of the lounge""",B Stewart,2009-01-05,The renovated Qantas Club at Perth International is a vast improvement over the old one. It's looks and feels like the other Mark Newson designed Qantas lounges with the seemingly larger space punctuated with different areas serving different purposes. The toilet and shower facilities are also much improved while the food and drink on offer has not changed since the old days. The only major gripe would be the extremely warm temperature of the lounge which was acknowledged by the receptionist as being problematic.,4,perth airport,,,,4,5,3.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,no,
