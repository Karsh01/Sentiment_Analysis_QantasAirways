0,"""You are separated by a fixed divider”",Michael Kinder,2022-09-29,"✅ Trip Verified |  In September we took our first Business Class flight for a couple of years returning from Samoa on QF340. With a flight time of 6.5 hrs and late arrival into Sydney, we were looking forward to the extra comfort and service. We had seats 5E & 5F located next to each other in the center of the aircraft. The seat design is an insult to passengers travelling together, the idiot who designed these seats has no idea about the needs of travelling companions. You are separated by a fixed “divider” making it almost impossible to see each other and have any form of conversation. My wife is an anxious flyer due to an experience with an emergency landing which almost had a fatal outcome for all on board. Being separated like this made it very difficult for her, I spent half the flight on the edge of my seat leaning around the “divider” so I could talk to and console my wife who was stressed throughout the flight, very uncomfortable. Economy Class would have been so much better. There was no welcome drink or an amenities kit – where has the Qantas standard gone! For dinner we were served roast chicken that was inedible, tough and chewy! No entrée and the little dessert cake came in a paper box. After eating half of the dessert, I stopped due to a piece of the paper lining coming free and ending up in my mouth – disgusting! My wife didn’t touch her dessert. Why are we paying extra for this rubbish, had better meals in economy. While the seat and food proved to be a huge disappointment, the staff were very friendly and attentive. Being a “gold for life” Frequent Flyer, I have experienced many O/S business class flights over the past 25 years but this was the worst, never again – Qantas has totally lost the plot!! When we go to Europe next year, it will be on another airline.",2,business class,a330-300,1x2x1,september 2022,leisure,3.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,no,,,,,

Our seats were in the 2-3-2 configuration as we were seated at the very rear of the aircraft 58 D,E & F. The first thing I noticed when I managed to ‘contort’ myself into the seat was the absolute ridiculous lack of legroom. I am a tall man and expect this to occur, however I flew to Singapore in March on the same type of aircraft in Economy and found the legroom to be significantly different in that it was slightly larger. I could extend my legs without hitting the seat in front. This was not the case however. I felt sorry for the poor person in front as I continually bumped his seat trying to get comfortable. In addition the try table was broken and I had to support it with my legs during meal service.The seat USB also wasn’t working. Entertainment screen was good, just a little unresponsive, this wasn’t an issue though. I know there is the age old ‘you can always pay the extra!’ I need to point out though, like many people this is just unaffordable plus at this point in time Qantas doesn’t have premium economy on this route on this aircraft. Extra legroom seats were also unavailable. I  choose Qantas from loyalty and have never had a bad experience with anything until now.

It started with the awful Premier lounge at DPS, continued with no fast lane for Business in the gate lounge, a cramped bus ride out on the tarmac, only to find we had seats with just slight recline, not proper lie flat seating I'd expected in a 6 hour night flight in business. The food on the plane was mediocre. The entertainment consisted of 16 movies suited to teenagers and some recycled TV series. I couldn't even find any music albums. The headset provided was not noise cancelling. I am 73, very tall and not agile, and when I needed to go to the bathroom it was almost impossible to get out of my window seat because the people in front had reclined their seats.

The window seats look like you have to climb over the person on the aisle, but it looks like there is enough room so that you do not disturb the person on the aisle. Qantas gives you pajamas to change into for a long flight that are very comfy. They also have a ""mattress"" that they lay on the seat prior to sleeping.

Disappointed with Qantas this time after previous trip 2.5 years ago. We were row 70 on the way over late August and row 69 on the way back. This is where the meal service trolleys converge. The customer service was sub optimal, I accept that sometimes you cannot have the meal you'd like, however I do not like being asked what I would like and then being ignored while 8 staff have an 8 way conversation about other people's meals. Very poor, not even an ""excuse me"" from the staff while they spoke to their colleagues. I was the 3rd person to use the toilet after leaving Heathrow , it smelt of urine on the floor and there were grimy hand prints on the area around the lock. Not good when you know you are in the same seat for the best part of 26 hours. I'd question if it was cleaned before departure. The cabin was freezing, I accept that it is for air filtration (and we did not return with a cold, so job done, thanks Qantas) I heard other passengers asking about it to be fobbed off. It was a pleasure to swap onto the Emirates A380 in Sydney for the last leg.

I've heard reports that people congregate in this area while waiting for the nearby bathrooms but I didn't see that on this flight albeit the cabin was not full. The bathrooms, the rear Business Class ones, are behind a curtain. The leg room is huge and the service starts at your seat. These side pairs of seats in a 2-3-2 cabin could be good for couples too, but the seats on the aisle may see some leg & foot interaction with people walking past during the night. Other reports are that it is cold in this row by the door. But I didn't experience that. The blankets and pillows are as provided in Business Class. The seat is pretty good with a decent width and recline. The TV Screen comes out of the armrest and is of reasonable quality.

I had a broken footrest on one leg which while I could have relocated to another seat on the way over I wouldn't have been able to on the way back and that would have significantly reduced the comfort of the seat. Even then it's still not a huge seat and really it's not that comfortable, I have been more comfortable on a Singapore Airlines economy seat. Staff were quite good, reasonably attentive and fairly cheerful on such a long flight. The food was disappointing. I can't imagine what economy were getting. It was good, but not that good. The full breakfast is full of salt so beware, vegetarian meal was good but the bread was always stone cold, very, very poor. Regular pasta meal my partner had was awful. I don't fly a lot and in recent years it's only been on singapore airlines so I might be spoilt. But, that said, I did shell out the full fare on Qantas for a business class ticket some years ago and it was disappointing. Maybe this is the new normal but for my money Qantas needs to do better.

The amenities have been down-graded since then, but over all, I have found the staff on all my flights to be excellent.  I agree that the cost for PE has increased over the years, but if you keep your eye out for flight deals from Qantas and their partners, then the higher price compared to normal economy is not double.

Legroom above average with plenty of space between myself and the seat in front of me - even when the seat in front was fully reclined. Seat pitch is far above the limited seat pitch in a conventional economy cabin. Tray tables are stowed in the left armrest and is fully flexible and adjustable to suit the 'shape' of the passenger and the meal service. PTV is stowed in the right armrest and can be used comfortably in conjunction with the tray table. IFE system is fast and responsive and had a good selection of shows and latest releases. A word of caution however is to check the aircraft operating your flight as the PTVs and IFE system was older on my return leg to JNB. Fewer options a more outdated UI and a disappointing experience. Almost all movies had Chinese and/or English subtitles - which for me was a deal breaker and resulted in me rather reading a book. This is a personal preference however but I would of appreciated an option to remove this!

My wife and I travelled with our 5 year old. The flight was QF2 from Dubai to Sydney. We liked row 38. The seat reclined fully no one kicked the back of our seats and we did not have to be concerned shout reclining into someone's lap. In addition there was some space behind the seat to put blankets etc. The aircraft had large storage bins which took our hand baggage with no issues The seat location meant that we were close to a choice of toilets and also the self serve food area The cabin staff were excellent - friendly attentive and coming round on a regular basis with drinks and goodies (m&m's etc). The quality of the food was very good as was the range of drinks available. There was plenty to eat onboard and the self service area was topped up with goodies. Also Qantas serve good coffee and hot chocolate with marshmallows. There were never any queues for the toilets and we were not bothered by any noise from the nearby galley. However the seat is no where as comfortable as Emirates and although the IFE is good it us not a patch on Emirates The legroom is ok but when the seat in front reclines it reclines right into your lap making a long journey very uncomfortable. On a 13+ hour flight! there were no goodie / activity bags given out to our 5 year old and the choice of children's movies was quite limited. On our first leg a Emirates flight my daughter thought Santa was on the plane due to the huge amount of stuff she was given. We had a lot of turbulence and no warnings etc from the captain. On the Emirates leg the captain warned us in advance and then after some heavy bumps came on and reassured everyone that all was well. If I had the choice I would chose the Emirates A380 over Quantas' A380 on a long flight purely due to the much more comfortable seat better IFE and great goodies for kiddies. Thus outweighs (for us) our experience that Qantas have more friendly and attentive cabin crew.

68,"""seats recline beautifully""",A Dey,2013-02-15,LAX to Sydney. The economy A380 seats are a disgrace. The backs are thinner making every movement and touch from behind felt immediately. The seats recline beautifully - except the lovely recline means you are lying in someone's lap and someone is probably lying in your lap. This makes sitting up and reading impossible if the person in front of you goes to sleep before you do. The entertainment screen is also too close to see clearly as soon the seat in front of you is reclined. Lucky for me the gentleman in front of me was asked to raise his seat back so I could eat. The seats themselves are barely wide enough to sit in. There is less leg room than any other flight I've been on in my life. To eat requires the capacity to keep one's arms glued to one's sides while wielding a fork and knife so one is not elbow jousting with the neighbor. The tray table is so small it barely fits the tiny food tray which is all of about 9 x 5 inches. The entertainment screen remote is tucked away in the arm between the seats so you have to ask the person next to you to move his arm to retrieve it. Then you have to slam the armrest lid down on the attached cord without breaking it. I just kept the remote out and hanging off the edge of my seat so I didn't have to bother that poor guy again. The armrests also do not raise all the way so if you are fortunate enough to have an empty seat next to you you can't get rid of it and stretch out a bit more or rest your head against the next seat.I weigh 100 lbs/about 47 kg. I am thin and not tall. This seat was uncomfortable for me. Now imagine what it is like for any normal human.

The seat is a window seat so you have the storage thing on the wall to your left to put things in where as if you were 48B or 48C you would have no where. It has part of the door sticking out in front of your left leg so if your over 6'0 you can't really stretch your leg out fully. I'm 6'4 and didn't have a problem with this as you can angle both legs to one side and not obstruct the person to your right and it was intrusive either.. and the best thing is this seat only cost $25 to book compared to the $160-180 they charge for the other extra leg room seats/exit seats (including the two next to you). People say the seats are bad and in August I said this myself I felt they were too hard but for some reason it was fine this time almost like the cushions have been replaced and I really enjoyed the ride. If flying on an A380 with 31"" or less leg room like Qantas you'll want to book a better seat as passengers behind you have no room and can hardly see the TV's quite ridiculous. The seats recline too much. I think a better foot rest would be better than 2"" extra recline.",8,economy class,a380,3x4x3,,,,,,,,,,yes,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0

76,"""tightest for legroom""",S Dodd,2012-12-03,I've just completed 8 flights with Qantas and half of them including the B747 were like torture. I'm quite tall and can't afford to buy the extra-legroom seats. I joined their frequent flyer programme in the hope of getting aisle seats but that didn't work. These flights were the tightest for legroom of any of the very many airlines I've used. Knees hard up against the seat in front with no chance of any movement - even worse when the seat in front recliners. On an 8 or 13 hour flight it's hardly bearable.

Get to my seat and find that something is wrong with my earphone jack so only get sound in 1 ear. The armrest doesn't raise up completely so no one can lean on each other. The leg room itself was okay but nothing fantastic. I'm 6'5 tall and no matter what it's never going to be great I worked out how to move my legs to get maximum space. Flight attendants poor performance by fussing over pseudo celebrities on the flight and not caring much for anyone else. Will avoid Qantas if possible in the future.

78,"""very poor seats on the A380""",Wendy Harris,2011-10-22,Traveled with my husband and son on the A380 flying from SYD - LAX return using the A380 both ways flying economy. Very poor seats on the A380. They were hard and not comfortable at all. The seat width was the same width as the Virgin Australia domestic plane and the leg rest was almost impossible to use if the person in front of you reclined their seat. And once they do recline you can't get your bag from off the floor and it's almost impossible to get out of your chair. It's almost as bad as flying the domestic Qantas planes.,2,economy class,a380,3x4x3,,,,,,,,,,no,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,4.0
79,"""seating was cramped""",Michael Kelly,2011-09-19,QANTAS promotes the A380 as their flagship what a bitter disappointment the service and food quality was good economy class seating was cramped cushioning comfortable and reasonably supportive there was no additional room to store reading matter Ipad or glasses. The entertainment system was excellent. Getting from the window seat to the aisle required the other 2 passengers to move from their seats to be stuck in this situation for 12 hours is inhuman the plane was fully occupied. In future I will become more selective in choosing the carrier who provides the best seat pitch on long haul flights.,4,economy class,a380,3x4x3,,,,,,,,,,no,1.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,3.0
80,"""the seat supports me""",Jonathan Blanks,2011-07-28,"Seat 35a I'm tall 6'3"" and long-legged so it's vital I not only have enough legroom but that the seat supports me - I'm also reasonably skinny so can't take a hard seat. There are no exit seats on Qantas 747 Premium Economy only regular seats bulkhead seats and seats with back to bulkhead. 35a is the window seat second row in - I have to say the legroom is terrific no risk of banging my knees - also I could fully stretch my legs under the seat in front which I would not have been able to do with the bulkhead seat And the recline is very good though I believe less so if your seat backs onto the bulkhead (row 37). Only downside is you share loos with Economy. Noise cancelling headphones are good but the AVOD system is looking dated - A380 is much better. Foot rest is useless for taller people - they would be better off having an additional bar to flip out under the seat in front. Seat width is more than adequate for me being a narrow girth. It isn't business class - you have to pay alot more for that - but you do get treated more individually than in economy - and Premium Economy being a small cabin it feels more individual - Qantas get a big thumbs up from me for the overall experience.",8,premium economy,boeing 747-400,2x4x2,,,,,,,,,,yes,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0
81,"""no TV unit at all""",Chris Capetanakis,2011-07-28,Hong Kong to Melbourne with no TV unit at all. I was told nothing could be done about it. Nine hours of sitting in a seat with nothing to do. The attendants kept offering me drinks which I thought was odd especially after they advise to keep alcohol consumption to a minimum. What made it worse was that I paid extra for the seat I was in a total waste of money.,3,economy class,boeing 747-400,2x4x2,,,,,,,,,,no,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0
82,"""seats are tight in Coach/Economy""",Jim Ash,2011-06-03,The seats are tight in Coach/Economy although the added touches already on your seat when boarding were nice - blanket and pillow as well as headphones and a toothbrush. The Q- Snack care package given to passengers is a nice touch in case one gets a little hungry in between meals. My tv did not work and although there were a couple of open seats 21 rows back I chose not to move seats and before we landed at LAX the First Attendant/Purser visited my seat and gave me some gifts and an apology for the inconvenience; I thought that was quite generous of him.,4,economy class,a330-200,2x5x2,,,,,,,,,,no,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0
83,"""made for a numbing 23.5 hours""",David Jones,2011-05-26,Sydney to London on the A380 paid $20 extra to get an exit row seat in order to get extra leg room (seat 66D) as I am over 6ft 2 tall. My main issue with the seats are that there was hardly any thickness to the bottom cushion of the seat so this made for a numbing 23.5 hours so much so that I was hardly able to sleep at all during the entire flight. I estimate that there was approximately only 2.5 inches of padding between the top to the mesh metal base of the seat. The B747 on the outgoing leg of the journey was a lot more bearable. Whoever gave these seats a Design Award must have had no sense feeling from the waist down or actually sat in them for a very short period of time. The only reason why I would recommend this seat would be for the extra leg room apart from that it is a very uncomfortable experience.,2,premium economy,a380,3x4x3,,,,,,,,,,no,5.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,4.0

My husband moved to a free seat beside him which gave me 2 but as seats are concave and armrest does not push up fully out of the way was impossible for me to take advance of 2 seats on a 13hr night flight.

85,"""very limited overhead storage""",Alan Mackenzie,2011-04-17,I fly to and from London from Melbourne about 10 times a year and try to fly premium economy or business as much as I can. With the introduction of the A380 I expected Qantas to improve seating in both cabins. Unfortunately not. The Premium Economy seat is OK but why would Qantas decide it should be at the back of the upper deck? There is very limited overhead storage especially for people with full size roll on bags. Being at the back on the plane there is far more lateral movement and it is very noticeable so in comparison to the 747 Premium economy I found myself less comfortable due to the bumping around had to shunt by carry on luggage in a different location to where I was and we were one of the later ones off the plane meaning a longer wait in the dreaded passport control. The food was pretty ordinary as well. I can never understand that these flights are always full yet Qantas bleats about struggling to make ends meet and keeps dropping the quality of services.,6,premium economy,a380,2x3x2,,,,,,,,,,no,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0
86,"""have more leg room and is pretty comfortable""",James Crocker,2010-08-14,Seated in 80A from MEL-SIN fantastic leg room as no seat in front of you and not an exit row so you do not have to pay for it. Family member was sitting in 80B and for economy seat this was pretty standard compared to other airlines besides for the fact there is a net to place you feet in under the seat in front. This makes it feel you have more leg room and is pretty comfortable. When seats recline the whole seat moves with you including the bottom part so this makes the seat seem to recline a bit more.,8,economy class,a380,3x4x3,,,,,,,,,,yes,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0

The amount of room in this bulkhead seat was excellent along with the ability to stretch out on the side lockers that every seat has on the top deck of the aircraft. Excellent AVOD and meals.

I found that the A380 was an uncomfortable flight as when the person in front reclines you are left hardly any leg room also found that the trays were smaller the toilets smaller. I would never fly with Qantas again as I found the ground staff rude and unhelpful when we complained that they had not put our party of 4 together they had even placed the two teenage girls in our party next to a young man which the ground staff explained that they could not make any seating changes we were lucky the flight crew were able to arrange other seating arrangements.,1,premium economy,a380,3x4x3,,,,,,,,,,no,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0

94,"""seats are very comfortable""",David O'Keeffe,2009-11-10,SYD-LAX. Had phoned through and paid for exit row seat on this flight and it was well worth the $160 AUD. The customer service officer on the phone said I'd be happy with this seat as the flight had been reconfigured. Was not too sure what she meant until I boarded and realised I had a premium economy seat. These seats are very comfortable and I enjoyed the extra seat width and elbow room. Service was fantastic and because we were seated directly behind P/E the drinks cart was not too far away. The seat itself is nice good recline (compared to regular economy) and not knocking elbows is good. TV and table all located in arm rests and easily accessible. As I had the window side of the seats there is the ability to squeeze shoes pillow between seat and wall. Only let down is lack of storage so accessing books/magazines or toiletries I needed to access the locker each time.,9,economy class,b747-400,2x4x2,,,,,,,,,,yes,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0
95,"""managed a decent amount of sleep""",Mark Keohane,2009-10-14,Premium Economy LHR-SYD-LHR A380. I had my eye on 38J and K (exit row rear right of the cabin) and managed to get them there and back. This gave us (me + wife) masses of legroom so that wasn't an issue. Recline is OK and we managed a decent amount of sleep though it still felt like airline sleep rather than truly restful sleep. Food was ordinary in truth though nicely served on linen china etc. Staff were excellent on three of the four legs. We were addressed by name on several occasions by smiling crew. On SYD-SIN leg the Customer Services Manager walked around and met everyone in the cabin shook hands and thanked us for flying with Qantas -then repeated this as we approached SIN! Premium Economy cabin is quite close to the tail so lateral movement is quite noticeable during turbulence. IFE is first-class; touch- screen intuitive interface and loads of choice. First time I've taken more than a passing interest. Only disappointment was that the screen has to be stowed during take-off and landing - precisely when the Skycam in the tail is at its most entertaining so you can't watch that part of the proceedings. And finally beware - while these two seats are the best in the cabin for legroom they are also the chilliest. This may be because they are near the galley which has to be cooled or it may be that it's next to the door - though I can't believe this would be the cause of a draught! In any case it was much warmer a few rows forward and we had to cover up well in the excellent blankets to avoid the worst of it and still there was an uncomfortably cool draught on our faces. This was true on both trips (both A380s but different aircraft). So while I'd recommend Premium Economy I'm not sure this is the best place to sit. The ultimate measure is that my wife suffered a lot less from her usual terminal jetlag (we've done this trip quite a lot) and said she would do it again which is not true of 'standard' Economy (there's no going back to Economy now).,8,premium economy,a380,2x3x2,,,,,,,,,,yes,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0

I requested an emergency exit seat with more legroom only to be told that I would have to pay an additional AU$160! However the services desk informed me that if I wanted an exit seat and sat by the window I would not have to pay anything at all - given that there was the section over the door sticking out which would result in my legs being slight angled but not in the way of the passenger next to me. Well worth it and saved me the money and I would recommend anyone wish for more legroom. Made getting in and out of the seat great and one needs to stretch the legs regularly on such a long flight.,7,economy class,b747-400,3x4x3,,,,,,,,,,yes,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0

For economy I find their 747-400 superior. The leg room under the seat in front is much less there's some netting that you can put your feet into - useless. There is no room to store any extra luggage you may have under there and I'm not sure what the hype was about with the seat pitch? Just another note we flew with a toddler and whilst he was too big to use the bassinets 3 of the 4 were already out of order?!,3,economy class,a380,3x4x3,,,,,,,,,,no,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0
